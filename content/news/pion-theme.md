Hey there, fellow PION fans! The preparation for the PION event is slowly on the way, and the would like to introduce the theme of this years' PION. Given the special nature of a PION event, we had the idea of attaching a theme to pion. <br>
**The theme for PION will be: $\pi$!** We believe this theme will suit PION greatly, as PION and its physics is deeply intertwined with $\pi$. Take the many different fields of physics, there is not one where $\pi$ does not show up! From statistical physics, astrophysics to the complicated theories of quantum mechanics, the list goes on: $\pi$ always finds a way of making an apperance. This is precisely wat makes the circular constant so fascinating. <br>
There are more links from PION to $\pi$ as well: the $\pi$-meson in particle physics is also referred to as a pion. The committee is currently brainstorming some more $\pi$-related ideas as well, so stay tuned.<br>
We look forward to telling you more soon,
\- The $\pi$-on Committee
