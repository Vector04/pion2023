Dear all,

Thank you all for coming to PION 2023! We hope you have enjoyed yourselves as much as we did.
It was great to see all teams try their best at the questions from our professors.
Stay tuned, for the full scores and solutions here in the near future.

Well done to all participants, and congratulations to the winners!
We hope you will do just as well representing the whole of the Netherlands at PLANKS next year!

Lots of love,
 \- the PION Commission
