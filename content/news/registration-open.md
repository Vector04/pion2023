Dear all,

We hope you had a great summer holiday! We are pleased to announce it is now possible to register for PION 2023. 

You can register via the [nsaweb website](https://nsaweb.nl/activiteiten/pion-2023). Note that you can register with a team of up to four students, or individually if you do not have a team. The registration fee amounts to â‚¬5,00 per team of four people. 

We hope to see you all soon!
 \- The PION committee
