## MSc Imaging Engineering
In this master’s programme, you will acquire top-level skills in the field of imaging engineering. You will start by combining your understanding of instrumentation engineering with knowledge of molecular structures and processes. You can then focus your master’s by choosing a specialisation to either create and optimise instrumentation (instrumentation specialisation) or develop applications of imaging techniques in (bio)chemistry (molecular specialisation).
Interested? Come to our Master’s Open Day on 11 November or 23 March.

## MSc Systems Biology
You will be educated to become an interdisciplinary Systems Biology scientist who is capable of combining mathematics and biology using computational, experimental and modelling tools and methods. This knowledge will help you understand the dynamic interaction between all the components of a living system, like genes, proteins, cells and their behaviour and environment in (human) health and disease.
