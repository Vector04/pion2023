## The Physics master's programme at Leiden University:

The Physics masterâ€™s programme is intimately related to the scientific research carried out at the Leiden Institute of Physics. You will spend approximately 50% of your programme on research, as a member of one of our top-level international research groups. We offer five research specialisations, with emphasis on either experimental or theoretical physics, which train you as an independent researcher. We also offer three specialisations that put Physics in broader societal contexts and train you for careers where a Physics background is an asset. Each of these specialisations aims at providing a combination of research independence and content proficiency that fully prepares you for your professional development.

## The Leiden-Delft MSc Quantum Information Science & Technology:

Quantum Information Science and Technology encompasses the understanding, design, construction and investigation of quantum information processing systems, such as quantum computers, quantum communication networks, and quantum sensors. The objective of the MSc programme Quantum Information Science & Technology is to provide its students with in-depth and combined knowledge from the four disciplines (quantum) physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science in order to enable them to stay at the forefront of fundamental knowledge of quantum technology and develop practical applications in the field.
